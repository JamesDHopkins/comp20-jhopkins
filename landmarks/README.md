# landmarks

This assignment illustrates more complex frontend work with javascript and jQuery, and is also linked
to a backend POST path via a heroku server I created. This app gets user location data, sends it to 
a server and recieves a JSON response of all the historic landmarks within 1 mile of the supplied latitude and longitude,
as well as the past 100 user checkins to the POST request. It then displays on google maps the user's location,
the landmarks near them, and the past 100 checkins. 

Note: landmark data is only accurate for most parts of New England. Other locations are not guaranteed to recieve
an accurate response of nearby landmarks.
