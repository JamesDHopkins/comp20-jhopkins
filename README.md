COMP 20 Fall 2017 Repo for James Hopkins

This Repository contains the majority of my work during my comp 20 Web Programming class.


A link to my final web app, Autochef, can be reached here:

A big thanks to my teammates Yash Sathe and Michael Seleman for their contributions on Autochef.

Autochef is at its core a recipie search app that allows users to input information about items 
they may have in their fridge, and recieve recipies they can make using these ingredients. We use a
mongo database to store login information and corresponding fridge items. This allows users to leave the
app, come back, and still have the same items in their fridge. Logins are remembered on the front end 
via cookies so that the homepage can identify which fridge it needs to fetch.

Please note that this is not a completely finished product but a prototype, and the free version of the
Edamam API limits our app to 5 searches a minute.
